                                        I had
                                        many ways to celebrate the success along the way: new clothes every 20 pounds
                                        or so,
                                        getting my nails done, joining a gym. But probably the best 'treat' I gave
                                        myself was
                                        my husband!
                                        <br><br>
                                        I joined Match.com shortly after the weight loss, where I had a ton of fun
                                        dating and
                                        eventually met my now-husband, Mark. We'll celebrate our five-year anniversary
                                        in April
                                        and I've never been happier."

                                        <br><br>
                                        "In 2009, when I lost 17 pounds from switching my diet away from foods that I
                                        was sensitive to and were causing me to swell, I celebrated by buying myself a
                                        new wardrobe to fit the new me! I went from a 6/8 to a size 2 in jeans—I
                                        couldn't keep my old pants up! I never thought my butt could be so small. The
                                        best part was that I didn't feel deprived or hungry because I had lots of food
                                        choices and could eat the quantity I wanted of the foods that my body could
                                        handle.
                                        <br><br>
                                        I was so inspired that I got a doctorate and changed my career; now I am a
                                        holistic nutritionist and my virtual practice focuses on identifying hidden
                                        food sensitivities by using state-of-the-art testing and cutting edge dietary
                                        therapies. In the fall of 2009, my husband and I celebrated my weight loss and
                                        our 10-year anniversary by going on a romantic adults-only retreat to Cancun,
                                        and I rejoiced in a bikini—the kind I had told him I would never wear again
                                        after the second 50-pound pregnancy left me with so much extra weight."

                                        "Stress was a huge part of why I gained weight. My coping mechanism was to eat for comfort,
                                        which just made me depressed and eat more. I was 165 pounds, tired, and miserable all the
                                        time. I felt so ugly and lethargic. I was just tired of being tired, and I also had really
                                        high blood pressure. I literally woke up one day and said enough is enough. I was desperate
                                        to lose weight and I actually researched cosmetic surgeons before I researched personal
                                        trainers.
                                        <br><br>
                                        I figured I could spend my money and take the easy road or I could earn it. I trained with
                                        Terri Walsh, who helped me realize I wanted to earn my health and happiness more.
                                        Ultimately, I lost more than 40 pounds. She changed my life and I could never thank her
                                        enough."
