                                Often times, we think the best weight-loss strategies start with a lofty exercise
                                program. But the reality is that workouts are only one part of the picture, and there
                                are a slew of recommendations for how much exercise we should be getting on a regular
                                basis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for example, recommends
                                that adults should exercise 150 minutes a week at a moderate intensity, or incorporate
                                75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. Meanwhile, a study published
                                in Circulation found that the amount of exercise we get has a direct relationship to
                                our heart health—the more you get, the healthier your heart will be—and they suggest
                                two full hours a day as the new goal.

                                Basically, everyone's different, so it's hard to nail down a guideline that applies to
                                everyone, says Sara Gottfried, M.D., bestselling author of The Hormone Cure and The
                                Hormone Reset Diet. But if all else fails, remember this: Something is better than
                                nothing. That's why Dr. Gottfried suggests incorporating 30 minutes of moderate
                                intensity movement daily, devoting five minutes before your workout to an active
                                warm-up, then another five minutes to cool down and prevent injury. Once you've got
                                that down, you can layer on time and intensity. "After two weeks, add 10 minutes so
                                that you're exercising moderately for 40 minutes, four days per week, or increase
                                intensity," she suggests.

                                Finding something you enjoy is an important component to any fitness routine, too,
                                because—duh—it means you'll be more likely to stick with it. So if running isn't your
                                thing, don't sweat it—try a Zumba class, or meet girlfriends for Spin after work. (You
                                could even try working out according to your Zodiac sign.) "You might get results from
                                something you hate, but those results won't last," says Jess Sims, C.P.T., a Fhit Pro
                                trainer at Fhitting Room in New York City. And don't be afraid to branch out and see if
                                there's something else to love. "Varying your workouts will help keep you entertained
                                and help you progress because your body doesn't get used to the same movements," adds
                                Sims. Plain and simple: There's no one-size-fits-all workout, so don't box yourself in.

                                best way to lose weight naturally. "I could tell my patients to eat nuts and berries,
                                meditate, sit in a corner, and eat salmon. But if that doesn't work for them, they're
                                out," says Doornick. "It's important to be realistic about what people can and can't
                                do. Start where they want to start, and set realistic food parameters." (Here's why you

                                <strong>Befriend the produce section.</strong> It's no secret that eating vegetables is
                                good for you.
                                But shockingly, only 27 percent of American adults eat the recommended three or more
                                servings they should be getting daily, according to a CDC report. Aim to up your
                                vegetable intake to one pound per day. Not only will it help you hit your weight-loss
                                goals, but eating a rainbow of vegetables can also help protect against cancer, heart
                                disease, and the effects of aging. (Looking for dinner inspo? These creative recipes

                                <strong>Try intermittent fasting.</strong> Intermittent fasting (or IF) has gotten
                                trendy over the last
                                few years thanks to mainstream wellness pushes like the Bulletproof Diet. The concept:
                                Stave off food for 12 to 18 hours between dinner and breakfast, as doing so may offer
                                many of the same benefits of a low-calorie diet, like a lower incidence of
                                cardiovascular diseases. Couple it with high-intensity exercise and Dr. Gottfried says
                                you're looking at a winning combo.

                                <strong>Cut out grains for three weeks.</strong> As much as we love carbs, "most grains
                                have a fairly
                                high glycemic index, meaning that after one to two hours, your blood sugar surges,"
                                says Dr. Gottfried. "Unfortunately, foods that spike your blood sugar are chemically
                                addictive. They spur inﬂammation in your body and keep you in a downward spiral of
                                craving that can ultimately lead to a growing waistline." To break the cycle, try
                                scratching grains for less than a month, and pay attention to how your body reacts to

                                Between social media ads and TV commercial breaks, it's nearly impossible to escape
                                messaging around natural weight-loss supplements. A lot of them are plant-based—green
                                tea extract, bitter orange, raspberry ketones—and harmless-sounding. But do they work?

                                that results in significant weight loss. And, what's worse, many of them have side
                                effects that can hinder your fitness goals (including bloating and gas). Not exactly a
