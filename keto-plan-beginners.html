                                <br><br>
                                So you've decided you want to try out the high-fat, low-carb diet, better-known as the
                                fat-burning ketogenic diet. Whether it's to lose weight, have more energy, or fuel
                                workouts differently, going keto is a popular choice right now. But figuring out a keto
                                meal plan on your own is no easy feat, especially since eating a diet super high in
                                fats doesn't come naturally to many people who are accustomed to the traditionally
                                carb-heavy American diet. (It's especially hard if you're vegan and want to try keto.)
                                But this should help: Keto experts explain how to set yourself up for success, plus
                                provide ideas for exactly what keto foods to eat when you're first getting started.

                                When it comes to starting the keto diet (or any diet for that matter), there's one
                                thing all experts agree on. You *must* have a plan. "Never try to wing a keto diet,"
                                says Julie Stefanski, R.D.N., C.S.S.D., L.D.N., a dietitian based in York, PA, who
                                specializes in the ketogenic diet. "Set a start date and get prepared by reorganizing
                                your pantry, planning out meal and snack options, and purchasing appropriate foods and
                                dietary supplements," she says. "The biggest reason people have a hard time sticking
                                with keto is that people don't have enough interesting foods to turn to, and high-carb
                                favorites win out over good intention. If you didn't buy foods at the grocery store
                                that fit the guidelines, there won't be an easy option in the fridge when you really
                                need it." (A great place to start is this List of High-Fat Keto Foods Anyone Can Add to
                                Their Diet.)
                                <br><br>
                                What's more, it's especially important to make sure your diet is well-planned when
                                you're eating keto-style, because the foods you can choose from are limited. In
                                addition to checking in with a dietitian if you're able, Stefanski recommends that you
                                "talk to your doctor and make sure she or he is aware that you'll be starting a diet
                                that completely changes how your body metabolizes energy." You might also want to check
                                your most recent bloodwork levels for things such as cholesterol, vitamin D, and other
                                indicators of health because these can change while on keto. That's because for some
                                people, a prolonged keto diet can result in certain nutritional deficiencies or even
                                high cholesterol. But most experts will tell you that the ketogenic diet is not a
                                permanent lifestyle change (as could be the case for something like the 80/20 approach
                                to eating or a Mediterranean eating style).

                            <h2>When and How Much to Eat</h2>
                            <br>
                            <p class="article">
                                One thing many people love about keto diet meal plans is that tracking your food is
                                optional. "One of the biggest benefits of the ketogenic diet is that there's no need to
                                meticulously track your calories like you may in other diets," notes Dr. Josh Axe,
                                D.N.M., C.N.S., D.C., founder of DrAxe.com, best-selling author of Eat Dirt, and
                                cofounder of Ancient Nutrition. "Because you're filling up on fat and protein, you're
                                more likely to feel satisfied and energized all day long, which causes you to naturally
                                eat less." This isn't to say that food tracking on keto is discouraged. "Some people
                                may find calorie counting a useful tool to be more mindful and aware of what they're
                                eating, but it's not necessary on the ketogenic diet," says Dr. Axe, but there's no
                                need to get too stressed about hitting a certain caloric goal, especially if you're not
                                trying to lose weight. (Related: The #1 Reason to Stop Counting Calories)
                                <br><br>
                                One area where food tracking can be especially helpful, though, is ensuring that you're
                                hitting the right ratios of macronutrientsâ€”protein, carbs, and fat. "The most
                                researched version of the ketogenic diet derives 70 percent of calories from healthy
                                fats, 20 percent from protein, and only 10 percent from carbs," explains Charles
                                Passler, D.C., nutritionist, and founder of Pure Change. "In the ideal world, each keto
                                meal and snack should have that same (70/20/10) ratio of macronutrients, but studies
                                have shown that you'll still achieve great results even if each meal varies slightly
                                from that ratio, just as long as you don't exceed 50 grams per day of carbs, or eat
                                those carbs in one sitting," says Passler. In order to achieve these ratios without a
                                preset meal plan from a dietitian or doctor, some food tracking is probably going to be
                                necessary. But once you get the hang of things, you may not need it anymore.
                                <br><br>
                                How often you eat is also up to your personal preference. "For most people, I recommend
                                three to four meals per day with a few healthy keto snacks in between," says Dr. Axe.
                                "This ensures that you're getting a good mix of protein and fat all day long to keep
                                you feeling energized and satisfied." That being said, he encourages people to listen
                                to their bodies and tune in to when they're truly hungry. "If you find that you feel
                                better eating five to six smaller meals spread throughout the day, do what works best
                                for you."
                                <br><br>
                                Lastly, if you're active, you might need to make some adjustments to take that into
                                account. "For the first one to two weeks, temporarily reducing your exercise load can
                                be helpful as your body adjusts to being in ketosis," he says. "Additionally, for those
                                who have an intense workout schedule, carb cycling may be a good option." Carb cycling
                                essentially means you'll increase your carb intake on the days you're doing exercise,
                                ideally just two to three days per week. "While low-carb days may be around 20 to 30
                                grams of net carbs daily, high-carb days can range all the way up to 100 grams,
                                although it can vary based on your size and activity level," says Dr. Axe. (Related: 8

                                portion-counting since all yogurts naturally have lactose, which is a carb," says
                                Stefanski. "Pairing it with a carb-free protein like two eggs can help balance out the
