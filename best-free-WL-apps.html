                                Your smartphone is a perfect tool for getting and staying in shape. Think about it:
                                It's always with you, it lets you listen to music during your workout, and it provides
                                you with many powerful (free!) apps, right at your fingertips. A fitness app can lead
                                you through workouts without the high price of a personal trainer, and using a
                                calorie-counter app is as simple as sending a text. Together, they're a quick and easy
                                way to start getting in shape. Here, the best free weight-loss apps worth trying. (Also

                                If you're all about no-fuss apps, then Lose It! could be what you're looking for. It's
                                simple: You input your goal and track your food and exercise as well as your progress
                                toward that goal. The app also helps you find better food alternatives that are
                                healthier and good for your body. You can use their barcode scanner to track calories,
                                take pics of your meals for easy tracking, and even sync with the Apple Health and
                                Google Fit apps. Upgrade to premium for $3.33/month to get access to additional
                                features such as a meal planning tool, water tracking, macronutrient analysis, and
                                connection with your Fitbit or other activity trackers.

                                It can be super frustrating when you get on the scale and the number you see is higher
                                than the one from yesterday—even after a long workout or a day of eating well. Happy
                                Scale helps you understand why that number fluctuates so much while also keeping track
                                of your long- and short-term goals, monitoring your weight loss or gain, and predicting
                                when you could possibly reach your goal. (Read how non-scale victories are totally
